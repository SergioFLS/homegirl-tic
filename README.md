# homegirl-tic
This is a [TIC-80](https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80) compatiblity layer made for the [Homegirl Fantasy Console](https://github.com/poeticAndroid/homegirl).

## A word of warning
This is still missing several important functions, but some very basic programs should run already.
Right now, you can only load .lua scripts, but not .tic files. This means you will have to manually extract the code from the program you want to try to run. However, anything else stored in a .tic file has not been implemented yet. This heavily restricts which programs you can run.

## Installation
- Copy `tic.lua` into `usr:cmd`
- Copy `tic_big.8b.gif` into `usr:fonts`

## Usage
`tic [filename]` - Launch a .lua file using TIC-80 compatiblity mode
