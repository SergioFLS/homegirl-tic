# homegirl-tic
This is a [TIC-80](https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80) compatiblity layer made for the [Homegirl Fantasy Console](https://github.com/poeticAndroid/homegirl).

This is still missing several important functions, but some very basic programs should run already.

## Installation
- Copy `tic_compatiblity.lua` into homegirl's `libs` directory
- Copy `tic.lua` into homegirl's `cmd` directory

## Usage
`tic [filename]` - Launch a file using TIC-80 compatiblity mode
